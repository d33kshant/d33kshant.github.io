			<p class="section-contents">Hey there, my self Deekshant Yadav and I was born in 11th of July 2001. I am a self-taught programmer, currently perusing my bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science. I taught myself programming in c when I was 15. I still remember in 2008 we had our first computer in our home and since then my interest in computer has grown exponentially. In 2016 when the internet was gold, I discovered a program called turbo c and I wondered what this does? I was surprised with what I can do with that bad boy, so ladies and gentlemen this is how I got into programming. I first learned programming to make my own games but now I am more into making beautiful and feature rich mobile and web applications.</p>
