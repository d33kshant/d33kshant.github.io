hey, there! I am deekshant, a data science intern and a master's student in artificial intelligence. I have a background in computer science and past experience as a full-stack web developer, mainly in backend. I enjoy working with Python, AI-ML and open-source projects. I also like writing about my experiences and sharing what I learn.
