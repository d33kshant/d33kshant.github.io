# Hello, World!

I am deekshant, a data science intern at [Novartis](https://novartis.com) and a master's student at [Hyderabad University](https://uohyd.ac.in). I have a background in computer science and past experience as a full-stack web developer, mainly in backend. I enjoy working with Python, AI-ML and open-source projects. I also like writing about my experiences and sharing what I learn.
