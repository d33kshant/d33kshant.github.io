# About

<!-- I’m a data science intern at [@Novartis](#) and currently working on my master’s [@UOH](https://uohyd.ac.in). I have a background in computer science, having completed my four-year bachelor's degree. Before getting into AI and data science, I worked as a full-stack web developer, mainly handling backend development. Over time, I’ve built solid skills in Python and various AI-related libraries, which help me work on data-driven projects and problem-solving.

Aside from work and studies, I like contributing to open-source projects. I enjoy building and improving things that others can use while learning from the community. I also like writing about my experiences with AI, software development, and the challenges I come across. Whether it’s coding, researching, or sharing ideas, I’m always looking to learn and do something useful. -->
